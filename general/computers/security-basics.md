# Security

## CIA of Security

Goals of Security:

- Confidentiality
  - Data is kept confidential
- Integrity
  - Data is not mutated by unauthorized entities
- Availability
  - Ensure systems/data are available to authorize users when needed

Further goals:

- Auditing/Accountability
  - Logging/tracking
- Non-Repudiation
  - Eliminate uncertainty around a user's action

## Risk management

- Risk Management
  - identification, assessement, and prioritization of risk

- Assets
  - Anything the business benefits from
- Vulnerabilities
  - Weakness that allows asset to be exploited
- Threats
  - discovered action that exploits a vulnerability's potential to harm an asset
- Threat agent
  - entity that initiates a threat
  - often a person
- Likelihood
  - level of certainty that something bad will happen
  - quantitative/qualitative
- Impact
  - harm caused by threat

- threats applied to vulnerability is risk
  - `threats -> vulnerability = risk`

- NIST: National Institute of Standard and Technologies
  - NIST SP 800-30
    - document with huge list of vulnerabilities/threats
    - good starting place for risk management

## Threat actors

- internal/external
- level of sophistication
  - accidental or intentional
- intent
  - why, what were they trying to do
- use of OSINT (open-source intelligence)

- advanced persistent threat (APT)
  - get in a system and stay there

- examples
  - script kiddies
    - trivial attack knowledge
    - using pre-built scripts/tools
    - easy to block with basic security practices
  - hacktivist
    - intent is motivation
  - organized crime
    - smart groups of people
    - motivation is money
  - nation state
    - intelligence, resources, sophisticated tools
    - motivation is often intelligence
  - insiders
    - employee, contractor, etc
  - competitors
    - unlikely, as laws are often deterrent
